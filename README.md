# Interactive Orbital Dynamics Simulator

Inspired by my high school physics class, I created an orbital simulation game using python. 
I've mainly used this game as a means for applying my physics, math, and coding curiosity.

I've taken a lot of inspiration from Kerbal Space Program and attempted to recreate it using pygame. 
In the process, I have learned a great deal about event loops, simulation time steps, orbital dynamics, and so much more.
