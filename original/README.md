# Orbital-Game

Welcome to my Orbital Simulation Game!

Inspired by my recent high school physics class, I've created an orbital simulation game using python. 
I've mainly used this game as a means for applying my newly learned physics, math, and coding knowledge.

I've taken a lot of inspiration from Kerbal Space Program and attempted to recreate it using pygame. 
In the process, I have learned a great deal about event loops, simulation time steps, orbital dynamics, and so much more.

I've also tried to map all my changes using a proper git flow to prepare myself for the professional development world.
